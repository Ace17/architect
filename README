Introduction
------------

Architect is an interactive generic asset editor.

It currently contains basic support for sound, textures, tilemaps.
3D mesh support is in progress.

It allows users to specify their documents as a sequence of edit steps to the
final rendering. The list of edit steps is itself computed from composable and
parameterizable templates.

Each keystroke causes the editor to re-compute the list of edit sequence, and
to immediately execute it to show the resulting output to the user.

Architect is written in the D programming language.

Credits
-------

This project contains code from "ktg", a public-domain texture generator written by Fabien Giesen.
A lot of thanks to him!
The original texture generator is available on github, as a part of the fr_public repository.

And thanks to all the members of the Farbrausch demomaker group,
who I find to be a constant source of inspiration!
