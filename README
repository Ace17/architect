Introduction
------------

Architect is an instand-feedback generic editor.
It allows users to specify its document as a sequence of edit steps to the
final rendering. The list of edit steps is computed from composable and
parameterizable templates.

Each keystroke causes the editor to re-compute the list of edit sequence, and
to immediately execute it to show the resulting output to the user.

Architect is written in the D programming language.
