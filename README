Introduction
------------

Architect is an instand-feedback generic editor.
It allows users to specify its document as a sequence of edit steps to the
final rendering. The list of edit steps is computed from composable and
parameterizable templates.

Each keystroke causes the editor to re-compute the list of edit sequence, and
to immediately execute it to show the resulting output to the user.

Building
--------

$ make

(TODO)


Usage example
-------------

$ ./bin/architect-gui.exe demos/tiles.arc
